In 1972, the institution was formally recognized by the Ministry of Education as Assumption Business Administration College (ABAC), and in 1990, it achieved university status under its current name, granted by the Ministry of University Affairs. Operated by the Brothers of St. Gabriel, a global Catholic religious order established in France in 1705, the university emphasizes education and philanthropy, with a longstanding presence in Thailand dating back to 1901."
